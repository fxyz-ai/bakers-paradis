# 🍩 Baker's Paradis

**Baker's Paradis** is a creative collection of 89 unique pastries, including cakes, donuts, cupcakes, and pies. Each pastry is thoughtfully crafted with different combinations of flavorful batters and delicious toppings, making every item stand out with its own identity.

This dataset was designed to represent a playful and diverse bakery menu — perfect for showcasing bakery items, building mock UI layouts, or just exploring the fun behind custom dessert creations.

All items are well-structured in JSON format, each with a name, type, pricing, batter details, and topping combinations.

Whether you're working on a frontend demo or just experimenting with data, this project serves up sweet inspiration. 🍰
